## Package overview

It is rare that structural equation models (SEMs) are able to reject the null
hypothesis that there is no misspecification in the model. One explanation for
this problem is that covariance structures are influenced by major factors which
we can hypothesize about and minor factors which we cannot predict a-priori,
e.g. @maccallum_representing_1991.

### Goals

The goal of minorbsem is to let you fit Bayesian SEMs that estimate the
influence of minor factors on the covariance matrix following the approach in
@uanhoro_modeling_2023. Briefly, all residual covariances are estimated with
priors that shrink them towards zero, and the model returns the magnitude of the
influence of minor factors.

minorbsem also fits random-effects meta-analytic CFAs that capture the influence
of minor factors following the approach in @uanhoro_hierarchical_2022.

### Permitted models and supported data types

The package only fits a limited number of model configurations:

- CFA, allowing cross-loadings (which may be automatically estimated),
correlated errors terms, and fully oblique or orthogonal factors
(useful for fitting bifactor models)
- SEMs allowing latent regressions (only), cross-loadings, and correlated error
terms.

One cannot fit MIMIC, multi-group models, multilevel models, or models with
specially constrained parameters (e.g. setting two parameters equal).

The meta-analysis models are only for the CFA configurations.

All data are assumed multivariate normal, i.e. no binary, ordinal models.

## Installation

The package requires that you **have CmdStan installed on your machine**,
see installation instructions here: https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html

If you have CmdStan installed and working, go to: [Install minorbsem](#install-minorbsem).

### Install devtools

Restart R prior to installation. minorbsem requires that R is at least version 3.4.0. `version` command shows the installed R version. If the installed version is less than 3.4.0, then update R before proceeding.

Install `devtools` to allow installation of R packages that are hosted on GitHub instead of Cran (the default repository for R packages):

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

### Install CmdStanR and CmdStan

Install the `cmdstanr` package so `minorbsem` can interface with Stan. If any problems come up at this stage, see: [Getting started with CmdStanR](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html).

``` r
devtools::install_github("stan-dev/cmdstanr")
```

Install Stan. First, we check that the computer is correctly set up to install Stan:

``` r
cmdstanr::check_cmdstan_toolchain()  # ensure computer is setup to install Stan
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()  # install Stan
```

### Install minorbsem

Install minorbsem:

``` r
devtools::install_github("stonegold546/minorbsem")
```

## A reasonably complete demonstration

``` r
library(minorbsem)
# Basic Holzinger-Swineford model
syntax_1 <- "
F1 =~ x1 + x2 + x3
F2 =~ x4 + x5 + x6
F3 =~ x7 + x8 + x9"
# Expect a summary table output in Viewer
fit_1 <- minorbsem(syntax_1, HS)

# Save output table to html file, see: ?pretty_print_summary for more options
pretty_print_summary(fit_1, save_html = "baseline_model.html")

# Histogram of parameters, see: ?parameter_hist for arguments
parameter_hist(fit_1)

# Traceplot of parameters, see: ?parameter_trace for arguments
parameter_trace(fit_1)

# Examine all standardized residual covariances
plot_residuals(fit_1)
plot_residuals(fit_1, type = "range")
```

### Model comparisons

Fit a second model that estimates all cross-loadings and shrinks them to
0 using a global-local prior (`simple_struc = FALSE`).

Then compare both models using LOO. This needs the `loo` package: `install.packages("loo")`.

``` r
fit_2 <- minorbsem(syntax_1, HS, simple_struc = FALSE)

# Compute case wise log-likelihood
# exclude minor factor influences or else both models will fit data equally
ll_mat_1 <- casewise_log_likelihood(fit_1, include_residuals = FALSE)
ll_mat_2 <- casewise_log_likelihood(fit_2, include_residuals = FALSE)
chain_id <- posterior::as_draws_df(fit_1@stan_fit)$.chain

# loo for model 1
loo_1 <- loo::loo(
  ll_mat_1,
  r_eff = loo::relative_eff(ll_mat_1, chain_id = chain_id)
)
print(loo_1)

# loo for model 2
loo_2 <- loo::loo(
  ll_mat_2,
  r_eff = loo::relative_eff(ll_mat_2, chain_id = chain_id)
)
print(loo_2)

# Compare both models
print(loo::loo_compare(loo_1, loo_2), simplify = FALSE)
```

## Additional examples

### Different methods to capture the influence of minor factors

Default method above is `method = "normal"` assuming standardized residual
covariances are on average 0 and vary from 0 in continuous fashion.

``` r
## Fit same model as above but use global-local prior to estimate
# minor factor influences
fit_gdp <- minorbsem(syntax_1, HS, method = "GDP")
plot_residuals(fit_gdp)
parameter_hist(fit_gdp)
parameter_trace(fit_gdp)

# Ignoring minor factor influences
fit_reg <- minorbsem(syntax_1, HS, method = "none")
parameter_hist(fit_reg)
parameter_trace(fit_reg)

# Error!!!: Plotting residuals will give an error message
# since minor factor influences are assumed null
plot_residuals(fit_reg)
```

There are other methods, see details section in `?minorbsem`.

Model comparison via LOO works as above in the [first example](#model-comparisons).

### Meta-analytic CFA

``` r
# An example in the metaSEM package, 11 studies, 9 items.
model_syntax <- "# latent variable definitions
F1 =~ JP1 + JP2 + JP3
F2 =~ JN1 + JN2 + JN4 + JN4
F3 =~ TD1 + TD2"
meta_fit <- meta_mbcfa(
  model_syntax,
  sample_cov = issp89$data, sample_nobs = issp89$n
)

# Histogram of parameters, see: ?parameter_hist for arguments
parameter_hist(meta_fit)

# Traceplot of parameters, see: ?parameter_trace for arguments
parameter_trace(meta_fit)

# Examine all standardized residual covariances
plot_residuals(meta_fit)
plot_residuals(meta_fit, type = "range")
```

There are other methods, see details section in `?meta_mbcfa`.

Model comparisons are not yet implemented for meta-analytic CFAs.
@uanhoro_hierarchical_2022 addresses moderation (via meta-regression) and
missing data in input covariances -- these are not yet implemented.
