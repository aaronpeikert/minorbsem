Structural information for the prior mean of the dispersion matrix is incorporated into the analysis through a Normal-Wishart prior distribution. Many of the resulting Bayes estimates are invariant, consistent and asymptotically efficient. Using this procedure, a coherent Bayesian argument for stochastic multiple regression analysis is developed, where dependent and independent variables are jointly random, without experimental control. It is shown that ordinary least squares, a general form of ridge regression, and factor analysis regression methods can be represented as special cases within this general framework. The preliminary report of a simulation study indicates that the Bayesian regression techniques demonstrate substantial improvements over least squares, even using frequentist criteria. Finally, the related problem of joint estimation of the normal population mean and dispersion matrix is briefly discussed in Section 5. The resulting Bayes estimate for the population mean is shown to be closely related to Stein estimates.},

Specifically, MASEM allows researchers to: (1) test whether the proposed models are consistent with the data; (2) estimate partial effects after controlling for other variables; (3) estimate functions of parameter estimates such as indirect effects; and (4) include latent variables in the models. We illustrate the procedures with an example on the theory of planned behaviour. Practical issues in MASEM and suggested solutions are discussed.},

This problem can be especially important in hierarchical models where the standard errors of fixed and random effects depend on estimation of the covariance matrix of the distribution of the random effects. We propose a set of hierarchical priors (HPs) for the covariance matrix that produce posterior shrinkage toward a specified structure\textemdash here we examine shrinkage toward diagonality. We then address the computational difficulties raised by incorporating these priors, and nonconjugate priors in general, into hierarchical models. We apply a combination of approximation, Gibbs sampling (possibly with a Metropolis step), and importance reweighting to fit the models, and compare this hybrid approach to alternative Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Our investigation involves three alternative HPs. The first works with the spectral decomposition of the covariance matrix and produces both shrinkage of the eigenvalues toward each other and shrinkage of the rotation matrix toward the identity. The second produces shrinkage of the correlations toward 0, and the third uses a conjugate Wishart distribution to shrink toward diagonality. A simulation study shows that the first two HPs can be very effective in reducing small-sample risk, whereas the conjugate Wishart version sometimes performs very poorly. We evaluate the computational algorithm in the context of a normal nonlinear random-effects model and illustrate the methodology with a logistic random-effects model.},

Meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) is a relatively new method in which effect sizes of different independent studies between multiple variables are typically first pooled into a matrix and next analyzed using structural equation modeling. While its popularity is increasing, there are issues still to be resolved, such as how to deal with primary studies in which variables have been artificially dichotomized. To be able to advise researchers who apply MASEM and need to deal with this issue, we performed two simulation studies using random-effects two stage structural equation modeling. We simulated data according to a full and partial mediation model and systematically varied the size of one (standardized) path coefficient ({$\beta$}MX~=~.16, {$\beta$}MX~=~.23, {$\beta$}MX~=~.33), the percentage of dichotomization (25\%, 75\%, 100\%), and the cut-off point of dichotomization (.5, .1). We analyzed the simulated datasets in two different ways, namely, by using (1) the point-biserial and (2) the biserial correlation as effect size between the artificially dichotomized predictor and continuous variables. The results of these simulation studies indicate that the biserial correlation is the most appropriate effect size to use, as it provides unbiased estimates of the path coefficients in the population.},

Frequently, the individual studies do not provide all the correlation coefficients between the research variables.

In this study, we address the major shortcomings of existing approaches by proposing a novel Bayesian multilevel SEM approach. Simulation results showed that the proposed approach performed satisfactorily in terms of parameter estimation and model fit evaluation when the number of studies and the within-study sample size were sufficiently large and when correlations were missing completely at random. An empirical example about the structure of personality based on a subset of data was provided. Results favored the third factor structure over the hierarchical structure.

  abstract = {Modeling correlation (and covariance) matrices can be challenging due to the positive-definiteness constraint and potential high-dimensionality. Our approach is to decompose the covariance matrix into the correlation and variance matrices and propose a novel Bayesian framework based on modeling the correlations as products of unit vectors. By specifying a wide range of distributions on a sphere (e.g. the squared-Dirichlet distribution), the proposed approach induces flexible prior distributions for covariance matrices (that go beyond the commonly used inverse-Wishart prior). For modeling real-life spatio-temporal processes with complex dependence structures, we extend our method to dynamic cases and introduce unit-vector Gaussian process priors in order to capture the evolution of correlation among components of a multivariate time series. To handle the intractability of the resulting posterior, we introduce the adaptive {$\Delta$}-Spherical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We demonstrate the validity and flexibility of our proposed framework in a simulation study of periodic processes and an analysis of rat's local field potential activity in a complex sequence memory task.},

For large-dimensional covariance matrices, the usual estimator\textemdash the sample covariance matrix\textemdash is typically not well-conditioned and may not even be invertible. This paper introduces an estimator that is both well-conditioned and more accurate than the sample covariance matrix asymptotically. This estimator is distribution-free and has a simple explicit formula that is easy to compute and interpret. It is the asymptotically optimal convex linear combination of the sample covariance matrix with the identity matrix. Optimality is meant with respect to a quadratic loss function, asymptotically as the number of observations and the number of variables go to infinity together.

  abstract = {Estimating a covariance matrix is an important task in applications where the number of variables is larger than the number of observations. Shrinkage approaches for estimating a high-dimensional covariance matrix are often employed to circumvent the limitations of the sample covariance matrix. A new family of nonparametric Stein-type shrinkage covariance estimators is proposed whose members are written as a convex linear combination of the sample covariance matrix and of a predefined invertible target matrix. Under the Frobenius norm criterion, the optimal shrinkage intensity that defines the best convex linear combination depends on the unobserved covariance matrix and it must be estimated from the data. A simple but effective estimation process that produces nonparametric and consistent estimators of the optimal shrinkage intensity for three popular target matrices is introduced. In simulations, the proposed Stein-type shrinkage covariance matrix estimator based on a scaled identity matrix appeared to be up to 80\% more efficient than existing ones in extreme high-dimensional settings. A colon cancer dataset was analyzed to demonstrate the utility of the proposed estimators. A rule of thumb for adhoc selection among the three commonly used target matrices is recommended.},

Analytical properties of the resultant procedure are investigated and the measure of misspecification is found to be related to the root mean square error of approximation. An algorithm is developed for numerical implementation of the procedure. The consistency and asymptotic sampling distributions of the estimators are established under a new asymptotic paradigm and an assumption weaker than the standard Pitman drift assumption. Simulations validate the asymptotic sampling distributions and demonstrate the importance of accounting for the variations in the parameter estimates due to adventitious error.

  abstract   = {Meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) is becoming increasingly popular for testing theoretical models from a pool of correlation matrices in management and organizational studies. One limitation of the conventional MASEM approaches is that the proposed structural equation models are only tested on the average correlation matrix. It remains unclear how far the proposed models can be generalized to other populations when the correlation matrices are heterogeneous. Recently, Yu, Downes, Carter, and O'Boyle (2016) proposed a full-information MASEM approach to address this limitation by fitting structural equation models from the correlation matrices generated from a parametric bootstrap. However, their approach suffers from several conceptual issues and technical errors. In this study, we reran some of the simulations in Yu et al. by correcting all of the errors in their original studies. The findings showed that bootstrap credible intervals (CVs) work reasonably well, whereas test statistics and goodness-of-fit indices do not. We advise researchers on what they can and cannot achieve by applying the full-information MASEM approach. We recommend fitting MASEM with the two-stage structural equation modeling approach, which works well for the simulation studies. If researchers want to inspect the heterogeneity of the parameters, they may use the bootstrap CVs from the full-information MASEM approach. All of these analyses were implemented in the open-source R statistical platform; researchers can easily apply and verify the findings. This article concludes with several future directions to address the issue of heterogeneity in MASEM. (PsycINFO Database Record},

MASEM typically consist of two stages. The method that has been found to perform best in terms of statistical properties is the two-stage structural equation modeling, in which maximum likelihood analysis is used to estimate the common correlation matrix in the first stage, and weighted least squares analysis is used to fit structural equation models to the common correlation matrix in the second stage. In the present paper, we propose an alternative method, ML MASEM, that uses ML estimation throughout. In a simulation study, we use both methods and compare chi-square distributions, bias in parameter estimates, false positive rates, and true positive rates. Both methods appear to yield unbiased parameter estimates and false and true positive rates that are close to the expected values. ML MASEM parameter estimates are found to be significantly less bias than two-stage structural equation modeling estimates, but the differences are very small. The choice between the two methods may therefore be based on other fundamental or practical arguments. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract   = {Meta-analysis plays a key role in combining studies to obtain more reliable results. In social, behavioral, and health sciences, measurement units are typically not well defined. More meaningful results can be obtained by standardizing the variables and via the analysis of the correlation matrix. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with the combined correlations, called meta-analytical SEM (MASEM), is a powerful tool for examining the relationship among latent constructs as well as those between the latent constructs and the manifest variables. Three classes of methods have been proposed for MASEM: (1) generalized least squares (GLS) in combining correlations and in estimating the structural model, (2) normal-distribution-based maximum likelihood (ML) in combining the correlations and then GLS in estimating the structural model (ML-GLS), and (3) ML in combining correlations and in estimating the structural model (ML). The current article shows that these three methods are equivalent. In particular, (a) the GLS method for combining correlation matrices in meta-analysis is asymptotically equivalent to ML, (b) the three methods (GLS, ML-GLS, ML) for MASEM with correlation matrices are asymptotically equivalent, (c) they also perform equally well empirically, and (d) the GLS method for SEM with the sample correlation matrix in a single study is asymptotically equivalent to ML, which has being discussed extensively in the SEM literature regarding whether the analysis of a correlation matrix yields consistent standard errors and asymptotically valid test statistics. The results and analysis suggest that a sample-size weighted GLS method is preferred for combining correlations and for MASEM.},

  abstract = {When a statistically significant mean difference is found, the magnitude of the difference is judged qualitatively using an effect size such as Cohen's d. In contrast, in a structural equation model (SEM), the result of the statistical test of model fit is often disregarded if significant, and inferences are drawn using " close " models retained based on point estimates of sample statistics (goodness-of-fit indices). However, when a SEM cannot be retained using a test of exact fit, all substantive inferences drawn from it are suspect. It is therefore important to determine the size of the model misfit. Standardized residual covariances and residual correlations provide standardized effect sizes of the misfit of SEM models. They can be summarized using the Standardized Root Mean Squared Residual (SRMSR) and the Correlation Root Mean Squared Residual (CRMSR) which can be used as overall effect sizes of the misfit. Statistical theory is provided that allows the construction of confidence intervals and tests of close fit based on the SRMSR and CRMSR. It is hoped that the use of standardized effect sizes of misfit will help reconcile current practices in SEM and elsewhere in statistics. Goodness-of-fit assessment refers to how well our model reproduces the data-generating process. When fitting a regression model, researchers assess the goodness-of-fit of their model by inspecting a plot of the standardized residuals versus standardized fitted values in order to check the linearity and homoscedasticity assumption of the model. Failure to meet the model assumptions will likely result in incorrect parameter estimates. Simply put, when the fitted model is incorrectly specified, all inferences based on it are suspect. In structural equation modeling (SEM), we fit a system of regression-like equations to our data (possibly involving latent variables), and procedures similar to those used in regression can be used to assess each of the equations in the model (Bollen \& Arminger, 1991; Coffman \& Millsap, 2006; Hildreth, 2013; Yuan \& Hayashi, 2010). However, they hardly seem to be used in applications. Rather, for historical reasons, the assessment of model fit in structural equation models has relied on the use of grouped data (residual means, covariances, and correlations) as opposed to individual residual observations. There is evidence that residual covariances (i.e., the differences between observed and fitted covariances) are sensitive to linear mis-specifications (Raykov, 2000) but I am not aware of any research that has examined whether they are sensitive to the presence of heteroscedasticity. Residual summary statistics such as residual covariances can be summarized into a single test statistic to assess the overall goodness-of-fit of a struc-tural equations model. Although overall test statistics are invariably reported in applications, they are most often ignored as they usually suggest that the model is incorrectly specified. Rather, Presidential Address to the Psychometric Society, delivered at the annual meeting in Madison (WI), July 2014. Rosseel for their helpful comments. I am also most thankful to Yves Rosseel for implementing these methods in the Lavaan package in R.},

  abstract = {Assessing the correctness of a structural equation model is essential to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions from empirical research. In the past, the chi-square test was recommended for assessing the correctness of the model but this test has been criticized because of its sensitivity to sample size. As a reaction, an abundance of fit indexes have been developed. The result of these developments is that structural equation modeling packages are now producing a large list of fit measures. One would think that this progression has led to a clear understanding of evaluating models with respect to model misspecifications. In this article we question the validity of approaches for model evaluation based on overall goodness-of-fit indexes. The argument against such usage is that they do not provide an adequate indication of the ``size'' of the model's misspecification. That is, they vary dramatically with the values of incidental parameters that are unrelated with the misspecification in the model. This is illustrated using simple but fundamental models. As an alternative method of model evaluation, we suggest using the expected parameter change in combination with the modification index (MI) and the power of the MI test.

In this paper, we describe and illustrate a general, efficient approach to Bayesian SEM estimation in Stan, contrasting it with previous implementations in R package blavaan (Merkle and Rosseel 2018). After describing the approaches in detail, we conduct a practical comparison under multiple scenarios. The comparisons show that the new approach is clearly better.

This approach is useful for measurement aspects of latent variable modeling, such as with confirmatory factor analysis, and the measurement part of structural equation modeling. Two application areas are studied, cross-loadings and residual correlations in confirmatory factor analysis. An example using a full structural equation model is also presented, showing an efficient way to find model misspecification. The approach encompasses 3 elements: model testing using posterior predictive checking, model estimation, and model modification. Monte Carlo simulations and real data are analyzed using Mplus. The real-data analyses use data from Holzinger and Swineford's (1939) classic mental abilities study, Big Five personality factor data from a British survey, and science achievement data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988.},

It also describes a novel parameter expansion approach for estimating specific types of models with residual covariances, which facilitates estimation of these models in JAGS. The methodology and software are intended to provide users with a general means of estimating Bayesian SEMs, both classical and novel, in a straightforward fashion. Users can estimate Bayesian versions of classical SEMs with lavaan syntax, they can obtain state-of-the-art Bayesian fit measures associated with the models, and they can export JAGS code to modify the SEMs as desired. These features and more are illustrated by example, and the parameter expansion approach is explained in detail.},

  abstract   = {Transformational leadership (TFL) has been proposed as an essential antecedent of leader\textendash member exchange (LMX), which in turn affects outcomes in organizations. We extend this mediation hypothesis in two ways by proposing a differential impact model, which we test on three organizational outcomes: employee job satisfaction, employee organizational commitment, and leader effectiveness. First, we extend LMX's mediational impact\textemdash which has previously only been tested for employee outcomes\textemdash to leader effectiveness. Second, we argue that this mediation will be stronger for outcomes that are more proximal rather than distal to dyadic relations between leader and followers (high proximity: job satisfaction; medium proximity: organizational commitment; low proximity: leader effectiveness). Meta-analytic structural equation modelling based on 132 studies revealed that LMX mediates TFL's relationships with employee outcomes (more strongly for job satisfaction than for commitment), but not with leader effectiveness, whereas TFL showed a stronger direct link to leader effectiveness. The findings suggest that TLF and LMX contribute differentially to organizational outcomes depending on their proximity to dyadic relations between leaders and followers. The differential impact model uncovers leadership effectiveness processes, integrates influential leadership theories, and highlights the importance of distinguishing between different outcome measures and the processes facilitating them.},

MASEM facilitates the evaluation of complete theoretical models (e.g., path models or factor analytic models), accounts for sampling covariance between effect sizes, and provides measures of overall fit of the hypothesized model on meta-analytic data. We propose a novel MASEM method, one-stage MASEM, which is better suitable to explain study-level heterogeneity than existing methods. One-stage MASEM allows researchers to incorporate continuous or categorical moderators into the MASEM, in which any parameter in the structural equation model (e.g., path coefficients and factor loadings) can be modeled by the moderator variable, while the method does not require complete data for the primary studies included in the meta-analysis. We illustrate the new method on two real data sets, evaluate its empirical performance via a computer simulation study, and provide user-friendly R-functions and annotated syntax to assist researchers in applying one-stage MASEM. We close the article by presenting several future research directions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

                To systematically evaluate the latent structure of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) through reanalysis of previous studies and meta confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).
                Method
                Data from 28 samples were obtained from published studies concerning the latent structure of the HADS. Ten models were considered, including eight previously identified models and two bifactor models. The fit of each model was assessed separately in each sample and by meta CFA. Meta CFA was conducted using all samples and using subgroups consisting of community samples, cardiovascular disease samples and samples from studies administering the English language version of the HADS.
                Results
                A bifactor model including all items loading onto a general distress factor and two orthogonal anxiety and depression group factors provided the best fit for the majority of samples. Meta CFA provided further support for the bifactor model with two group factors. This was the case using all samples, as well as all subgroup analyses. The general distress factor explained 73\% of the covariance between items, with the (autonomic) anxiety and (anhedonic) depression factors explaining 11\% and 16\%, respectively.
                Conclusion
                A bifactor structure provides the most acceptable empirical explanation for the HADS correlation structure. Due to the presence of a strong general factor, the HADS does not provide good separation between symptoms of anxiety and depression. We recommend it is best used as a measure of general distress.},

Yet, we argue that the sample and effect sizes in published psychological research are frequently so small that sample means are insufficiently accurate to determine whether treatment effects have occurred. Generally, an estimator should be more accurate than any benchmark that systematically ignores information about the relations among experimental conditions. We consider two such benchmark estimators: one that randomizes the relations among conditions and another that always assumes no treatment effects. We show conditions under which these benchmark estimators estimate the true parameters more accurately than sample means. This perverse situation can occur even when effects are statistically significant at traditional levels. Our argument motivates the need for regularized estimates, such as those used in lasso, ridge, and hierarchical Bayes techniques.},

A simulation study was performed with variations in model misspecification, factor loading magnitude, number of indicators, number of factors, and sample size. This showed that the 90\% posterior probability interval of the BRMSEA is valid for evaluating model fit in large samples (N ! 1,000), using cutoff values for the lower ({\textbackslash}.05) and upper limit ({\textbackslash}.08) as guideline. An empirical illustration further shows the advantage of the BRMSEA in large sample Bayesian CFA models.

  abstract   = {In a frequentist framework, the exact fit of a structural equation model (SEM) is typically evaluated with the chi-square test and at least one index of approximate fit. Current Bayesian SEM (BSEM) software provides one measure of overall fit: the posterior predictive p value (PPP χ2 ). Because of the noted limitations of PPP χ2 , common practice for evaluating Bayesian model fit instead focuses on model comparison, using information criteria or Bayes factors. Fit indices developed under maximum-likelihood estimation have not been incorporated into software for BSEM. We propose adapting 7 chi-square-based approximate fit indices for BSEM, using a Bayesian analog of the chi-square model-fit statistic. Simulation results show that the sampling distributions of the posterior means of these fit indices are similar to their frequentist counterparts across sample sizes, model types, and levels of misspecification when BSEMs are estimated with noninformative priors. The proposed fit indices therefore allow overall model-fit evaluation using familiar metrics of the original indices, with an accompanying interval to quantify their uncertainty. Illustrative examples with real data raise some important issues about the proposed fit indices' application to models specified with informative priors, when Bayesian and frequentist estimation methods might not yield similar results.

Our framework relies on dedicated factor models and simultaneously determines the number of factors, the allocation of each measurement to a unique factor, and the corresponding factor loadings. Classical identification criteria are applied and integrated into our Bayesian procedure to generate models that are stable and clearly interpretable. A Monte Carlo study confirms the validity of the approach. The method is used to produce interpretable low dimensional aggregates from a high dimensional set of psychological measurements.},

  abstract   = {Throughout the last two decades, Bayesian statistical methods have proliferated throughout ecology and evolution. Numerous previous references established both philosophical and computational guidelines for implementing Bayesian methods. However, protocols for incorporating prior information, the defining characteristic of Bayesian philosophy, are nearly nonexistent in the ecological literature. Here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors in ecology and evolution by providing a ‘consumer's guide’ to weakly informative priors. The first section outlines three reasons why ecologists should abandon noninformative priors: 1) common flat priors are not always noninformative, 2) noninformative priors provide the same result as simpler frequentist methods, and 3) noninformative priors suffer from the same high type I and type M error rates as frequentist methods. The second section provides a guide for implementing informative priors, wherein I detail convenient ‘reference’ prior distributions for common statistical models (i.e. regression, ANOVA, hierarchical models). I then use simulations to visually demonstrate how informative priors influence posterior parameter estimates. With the guidelines provided here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors for Bayesian analyses in ecology. Ecologists can and should debate the appropriate form of prior information, but should consider weakly informative priors as the new ‘default’ prior for any Bayesian model.},

A mixture of generalized linear models is used to describe the joint distribution of a set of underlying variables, and an arbitrary function relates the underlying variables to be observed outcomes. The model accommodates multilevel data structures, general covariate effects and distinct link functions and error distributions for each underlying variable. Within the framework proposed, novel models are developed for clustered multiple binary, unordered categorical and joint discrete and continuous outcomes. A Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm is described for estimating the posterior distributions of the parameters and latent variables. Because of the flexibility of the modelling framework and estimation procedure, extensions to ordered categorical outcomes and more complex data structures are straightforward. The methods are illustrated by using data from a reproductive toxicity study.},

In small samples, however, the likelihood surface is not Gaussian and in some cases contains local maxima. Nevertheless, the Gibbs sample comes from the correct posterior distribution over the parameters regardless of the sample size and the shape of the likelihood surface.

To create a wrong model, traditionally one specifies a perfect model first and then removes some paths. This approach becomes difficult or even impossible to implement in moment structure analysis and fails to control the amounts of misfit separately and precisely for the mean and covariance parts. Most importantly, this approach assumes a perfect model exists and wrong models can eventually be made perfect, whereas in practice models are all implausible if taken literally and at best provide approximations of the real world. To improve the traditional approach, we propose a more realistic and flexible way to create model misfit for multiple group moment structure analysis.

Population RMSEA is studied, removing the influence of sampling fluctuations and making the findings directly applicable to tests of close fit and not-close fit, which require the specification of a population cutoff value. Confirmatory factor analysis models are studied. The results introduce many new findings, including that RMSEA is often insensitive to multiple omitted cross-loadings and to clusters of correlated residuals, that it sometimes behaves counterintuitively as a function of model size, and that it is insensitive to the underlying number of latent factors when a model with one factor is fit.},

The horseshoe prior is a member of the family of multivariate scale mixtures of normals, and is therefore closely related to widely used approaches for sparse Bayesian learning, including , among others, Laplacian priors (e.g. the LASSO) and Student-t priors (e.g. the relevance vector machine). The advantages of the horseshoe are its robustness at handling unknown sparsity and large outlying signals.

  abstract = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic regression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the benefit of both of these theoretical advances.},

From the perspective that no mathematical model will fit real-world phenomena perfectly, it is suggested that this representation is problematic. It is not consistent with the phenomena it is intended to model, and it does not provide an adequate basis for understanding some issues inherent in factor analysis. An alternative representation of the model that incorporates a "lack-of-fit" term into the initial equation for the measured variables is proposed. Subsequent derivation of the covariance form of the model in the population and the sample yields a framework that allows for differentiation of various sources of error that arise in applications of the model. These developments provide a basis for study of some important issues such as model definition, parameter estimation, and sample size. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract   = {Ordinal variables, although extremely common in psychology, are almost exclusively analyzed with statistical models that falsely assume them to be metric. This practice can lead to distorted effect-size estimates, inflated error rates, and other problems. We argue for the application of ordinal models that make appropriate assumptions about the variables under study. In this Tutorial, we first explain the three major classes of ordinal models: the cumulative, sequential, and adjacent-category models. We then show how to fit ordinal models in a fully Bayesian framework with the R package brms, using data sets on opinions about stem-cell research and time courses of marriage. The appendices provide detailed mathematical derivations of the models and a discussion of censored ordinal models. Compared with metric models, ordinal models provide better theoretical interpretation and numerical inference from ordinal data, and we recommend their widespread adoption in psychology.},

Bayesian methods do not rely on asympotics, a property that can be a hindrance when employing frequentist methods in small sample contexts. Although Bayesian methods are better equipped to model data with small sample sizes, estimates are highly sensitive to the specification of the prior distribution. If this aspect is not heeded, Bayesian estimates can actually be worse than frequentist methods, especially if frequentist small sample corrections are utilized. We show with illustrative simula-tions and applied examples that relying on software defaults or diffuse priors with small samples can yield more biased estimates than frequentist methods. We discuss conditions that need to be met if researchers want to responsibly harness the advantages that Bayesian methods offer for small sample problems as well as leading small sample frequentist methods. In the last decade or so, Bayesian methods have become vastly more popular in nearly all scientific fields (van de Schoot, 2016). In fact, based on a comprehensive review of Bayesian studies over the last 15 years, van de Schoot (2016) noted that the number of empirical papers in psy-chology using Bayesian methods increased nearly fivefold between 2010 and 2015. This rapid increase is partially attributable to the decrease in the cost of computational resources needed to estimate the increasingly complex mod-els applied researchers are fitting to their data as well as increased accessibility to Bayesian software (Dunson, 2001), Mplus in particular, whose Bayesian module was available beginning in Version 6, which, not coincidently, was introduced in 2010. In addition to greater ease of implementation, several recent methodological papers and Monte Carlo simulation studies have noted the potential advantages of Bayesian methods over frequentist maximum likelihood (ML) meth-ods with small samples (e.. As research-ers are certainly aware, sample sizes in a vast array of behavioral science fields are frequently quite small. For instance, two meta-analyses by Roberts and colleagues found that about 33\% of growth models investigating personality traits over time had fewer than 100 people, a review by Russell (2002) found that about 40\% of explora-tory factor analysis studies in psychology had samples less than 100, 18\% of structural equation modeling (SEM) applications in psychology had samples less than 100 in a review by MacCallum and Austin (2000), 50\% of meta-analyses in education had fewer than 40 studies (Ahn, Ames, \& Myers, 2012), and the average number of clusters in registered primary care randomized trials was 29 (Eldridge, Ashby, Feder, Rudnicka, \& Ukoumunne, 2004). The issue of small sample size is highly relevant and the promise of Bayesian methods to handle these},

In this tutorial, we provide a non-technical discussion of the risks associated with the use of default priors in small sample contexts. We discuss how default priors can unintentionally behave as highly informative priors when samples are small. Also, we demonstrate an online educational Shiny app, in which users can explore the impact of varying prior distributions and sample sizes on model results. We discuss how the Shiny app can be used in teaching; provide a reading list with literature on how to specify suitable prior distributions; and discuss guidelines on how to recognize (mis)behaving priors. It is our hope that this tutorial helps to spread awareness of the importance of specifying suitable priors when Bayesian SEM is used with small samples.},

Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models.

A drawback of existing indexes is that they estimate no known population parameters. A new coefficient is proposed to summarize the relative reduction in the noncentrality parameters of 2 nested models. Two estimators of the coefficient yield new normed (CFIN) and nonnormed (FIN) fit indexes. CFIN avoids the underestimation of fit often noted in small samples for P. M. Bentler and D. G. Bonett's (see record 1981-06898-001) normed fit index (NFIN). FIN is a linear function of Bentler and Bonett's nonnormed fit index (NNFIN) that avoids the extreme underestimation and overestimation often found in NNFIN. Asymptotically, CFIN, FIN, NFIN, and a new index developed by K. A. Bollen (1989) are equivalent measures of comparative fit, whereas NNFIN measures relative fit by comparing noncentrality per degree of freedom. All of the indexes are generalized to permit use of Wald and Lagrange multiplier statistics. An example illustrates the behavior of these indexes under conditions of correct specification and misspecification. The new fit indexes perform very well at all sample sizes.

  abstract = {Accounting for model misspecification in Bayesian structural equation models is an active area of research. We present a uniquely Bayesian approach to misspecification that models the degree of misspecification as a parameter – a parameter akin to the correlation root mean squared residual. The misspecification parameter can be interpreted on its own terms as a measure of absolute model fit, and allows for comparing different models fit to the same data. By estimating the degree of misspecification simultaneously with structural parameters, the uncertainty about structural parameters reflect the degree of model misspecification. This results in a model that produces more reliable inference than extant Bayesian SEMs. Additionally, the approach estimates the residual covariance matrix which can be the basis for diagnosing misspecifications and updating a hypothesized model. These features are confirmed using simulation studies. Demonstrations with a variety of real world examples show additional properties of the approach.},

  abstract = {Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM) has recently gained popularity because it enables researchers to fit complex models and solve some of the issues often encountered in classical maximum likelihood estimation, such as nonconvergence and inadmissible solutions. An important component of any Bayesian analysis is the prior distribution of the unknown model parameters. Often, researchers rely on default priors, which are constructed in an automatic fashion without requiring substantive prior information. However, the prior can have a serious influence on the estimation of the model parameters, which affects the mean squared error, bias, coverage rates, and quantiles of the estimates. In this article, we investigate the performance of three different default priors: noninformative improper priors, vague proper priors, and empirical Bayes priors-with the latter being novel in the BSEM literature. Based on a simulation study, we find that these three default BSEM methods may perform very differently, especially with small samples. A careful prior sensitivity analysis is therefore needed when performing a default BSEM analysis. For this purpose, we provide a practical step-by-step guide for practitioners to conducting a prior sensitivity analysis in default BSEM. Our recommendations are illustrated using a well-known case study from the structural equation modeling literature, and all code for conducting the prior sensitivity analysis is available in the online supplemental materials.},

  abstract = {This paper considers Bayesian counterparts of the classical tests for goodness of fit and their use in judging the fit of a single Bayesian model to the observed data. We focus on posterior predictive assessment, in a framework that also includes conditioning on auxiliary statistics. The Bayesian formulation facilitates the construction and calculation of a meaningful reference distribution not only for any (classical) statistic, but also for any parameter-dependent "statistic" or discrepancy. The latter allows us to propose the realized discrepancy assessment of model fitness, which directly measures the true discrepancy between data and the posited model, for any aspect of the model which we want to explore. The computation required for the realized discrepancy assessment is a straightforward byproduct of the posterior simulation used for the original Bayesian analysis. We illustrate with three applied examples. The first example, which serves mainly to motivate the work, illustrates the difficulty of classical tests in assessing the fitness of a Poisson model to a positron emission tomography image that is constrained to be nonnegative. The second and third examples illustrate the details of the posterior predictive approach in two problems: estimation in a model with inequality constraints on the parameters, and estimation in a mixture model. In all three examples, standard test statistics (either a \&\#x3c7;2 or a likelihood ratio) are not pivotal: the difficulty is not just how to compute the reference distribution for the test, but that in the classical framework no such distribution exists, independent of the unknown model parameters.},

However, as will be shown, both are not suited for the evaluation of models based on small variance priors. In this article, a well behaving alternative, the prior-posterior predictive p value, will be introduced. It will be shown that it is consistent, the distributions under the null and alternative hypotheses will be elaborated, and it will be applied to testing whether the difference between 2 means and the size of a correlation are relevantly different from zero.
